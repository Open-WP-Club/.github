# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our projects and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Positive behavior includes:**

- Being respectful and constructive in discussions
- Accepting feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what's best for the project
- Showing empathy towards others

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**

- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Harassment of any kind, public or private
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This applies to all Open WP Club project spaces — issues, pull requests, discussions, and any public space where someone represents the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported by opening an issue or contacting us through [openwpclub.com](https://openwpclub.com). All complaints will be reviewed and addressed.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.
